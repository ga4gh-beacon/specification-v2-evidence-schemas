#### The (development) repository for evidence-type Beacon schemas

This repository is for exploation and development of "evidence" type Beacon schemas and schema elements, chiefly for the representation of variant annotations but also to inform and prototype query extensions.

At this time (January 2021) this repository should be considered "non-informative".
